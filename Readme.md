## Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in JavaScript. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced developer wanting to brush up on your skills, this repository has something for everyone.

## Features

- Implementations of common data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs).
- Various algorithms including sorting (e.g., quicksort, mergesort), searching (e.g., binary search), and graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm).
- Clear explanations and examples for each implementation.
- Performance analysis of different algorithms.
